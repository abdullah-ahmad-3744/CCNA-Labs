CCNA Day-14 Lab: Managing Router IOS (Deleting and Restoring via TFTP Server)
Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to practice checking the IOS version on a router, erasing the IOS image, and restoring it from a TFTP server. This exercise helps understand real-world IOS management and recovery procedures.

Step-by-Step Instructions

Step 1: Build the Topology in Packet Tracer
Devices Required: 1 Router (R1), 1 Server ( acts as TFTP server)

Connections:
R1 (FastEthernet0/0) âŸ¶ Server (FastEthernet0) 

Step 2: Configure Basic Router Settings (R1)
Enter Privileged EXEC Mode:
Router> enable
Enter Global Configuration Mode:
Router# configure terminal
Set Hostname:
Router(config)# hostname R1

Assign IP Address to Interface:
R1(config)# interface FastEthernet0/0
R1(config-if)# ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
R1(config-if)# no shutdown
R1(config-if)# exit

Step 3: Configure Server (TFTP Server)
Click Server.
Go to Desktop > IP Configuration and set:
IP Address: 192.168.1.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1
Go to Services tab > TFTP.
Make sure TFTP service is ON.
In the TFTP service window, upload a valid IOS image file (Packet Tracer provides a sample .bin file).

Step 4: Verify Current IOS on R1
In Privileged EXEC Mode, type:
R1# show version
Note the current IOS filename (e.g., c1900-universalk9-mz.SPA.bin).

Step 5: Erase the IOS from Router (Simulated in Packet Tracer)
Enter Privileged EXEC Mode:
R1# delete flash:<IOS_filename>
Example:
R1# delete flash:c1900-universalk9-mz.SPA.bin
Verify flash is empty:
R1# dir flash:
You should see no IOS image present.

Step 6: Copy IOS from TFTP Server to Router
Use the following command:
R1# copy tftp flash:
Address or name of remote host: 192.168.1.2
Source filename: <IOS_filename>.bin (the one stored in TFTP server)
Destination filename: press Enter to keep default
IOS will be copied into router flash.

Step 7: Verify IOS Installation
After copying, check the flash again:
R1# dir flash:
You should now see the new IOS file.


Step 8: Reload Router to Boot from New IOS
Save configuration:
R1# copy running-config startup-config
Reload the router:
R1# reload
Once it reboots, verify IOS version:
R1# show version
Ensure the router boots successfully using the new IOS.


Final Notes
This lab demonstrated IOS management: checking the OS, deleting it, and restoring it from a TFTP server. Always back up IOS images before deletion. In real networks, losing an IOS without a backup can make the device unusable. TFTP is widely used in Cisco environments for IOS upgrades, but in production, FTP/SCP is preferred for security.
