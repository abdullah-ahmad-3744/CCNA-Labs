üìò Lab: Basic Network Diagram  International Branches
Lab Objective:
To design a basic network diagram in Cisco Packet Tracer that visually represents a multinational company with three international branches:

Tokyo

London

Washington

This is a visual exercise only no IP addressing or device configuration is required. The focus is to understand the physical layout and logical grouping of international networks.

 Devices Required (Per Branch):
1 Router

1 Switch

2 End Devices (e.g., PCs or Laptops)

1 Cloud device (to represent the Internet/WAN)

üìù Instructions:
1. Launch Cisco Packet Tracer
Open Cisco Packet Tracer and prepare a new project file.

2. Create Three Branches
Each branch should include:

1 Router connected to a Switch.

2 End Devices (PCs or Laptops) connected to the Switch.

Connect the Router to a Cloud device to represent the internet.

Label each section as:

üè¢ Tokyo Branch

üè¢ London Branch

üè¢ Washington Branch

3. Connect All Branches to the Cloud
Place one central Cloud (Internet) device in the middle.

Connect each branch's router to this Cloud using straight-through cables (or simulate WAN links as you prefer).

This represents that all branches are remotely connected via a global network (e.g., the internet or MPLS).

4. Organize and Label
Use labels to name routers, PCs, switches, and each branch clearly.

Arrange branches left (Tokyo), center (London), and right (Washington) for visual balance and connect them the Head office

‚úÖ Outcome:
At the end of this lab, you will have a clean, professional-looking network topology showing how three international branches connect to each other logically over a shared cloud (internet).

No configurations are required. This is purely a topology design exercise.
