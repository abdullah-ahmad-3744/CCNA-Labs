Objective:
Learn how to manually configure IP addresses.

Lab Steps:
Step 1: Open Cisco Packet Tracer and Set Up the Network Topology
Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

From the bottom-left device types panel:

Drag 1 PC (found in End Devices).

Drag 1 Switch (e.g., 2960 from Switches).

Drag 1 Router (e.g., Router-PT or 1841 from Routers).

Now connect them:

Use Copper Straight-Through cable (light orange wire icon).

PC â†’ Switch: Connect from PCâ€™s FastEthernet0 to Switchâ€™s FastEthernet0/1.

Switch â†’ Router: Connect from Switchâ€™s FastEthernet0/2 to Routerâ€™s GigabitEthernet0/0 or FastEthernet0/0, depending on router model.

ðŸ“Œ Goal: Create a simple network:
PC <--> Switch <--> Router

Step 2: Configure Static IP Address on PC
Click on the PC and open the Desktop tab.

Click on IP Configuration and set the static IP address:

IP Address: 192.168.1.10

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1

Click on the OK button to apply the settings.

Step 3: Configure Router's Interface with Static IP
Click on the Router and open the CLI tab.

In the CLI, enter the following commands:

enable

configure terminal

interface gigabitEthernet0/0 (or fastEthernet0/0 depending on router model)

ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0

no shutdown

Press Enter after each command and save your configuration.

Step 4: Test the Network Connectivity
Go to the PC and open the Command Prompt.

Type the following command to check if the PC can reach the router:

ping 192.168.1.1

If successful, the configuration is correct.

Step 5: Conclusion
You have successfully configured a static IP address on a PC and router interface.

This setup demonstrates basic network connectivity between devices using static IP addresses.
